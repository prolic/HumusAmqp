## [Documentation](https://humusamqp.readthedocs.io/) powered by Read the Docs.

## Overview

PHP 7 AMQP libray supporting multiple drivers and providing full-featured Consumer, Producer, and JSON-RPC Client / Server implementations.

The JSON-RPC part implements [JSON-RPC 2.0 Specification](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification).

Current supported drivers are: [php-amqp](https://github.com/pdezwart/php-amqp) and [PhpAmqpLib](https://github.com/php-amqplib/php-amqplib).

php-amqp needs at least to be v1.8.0beta1.

This library ships with `container-interop` factories that help you setting up everything.

## Installation

You can install prolic/humus-amqp via composer by adding `"prolic/humus-amqp": "^1.1"` as requirement to your composer.json.

## Usage

### Exchange

    $exchangeName = 'test-exchange';
    $exchange = ExchangeFactory::$exchangeName($container);
    
    $exchange->publish('test-message');


### Queue

    $queueName = 'test-queue';
    $queue = QueueFactory::$queueName($container);
    
    $message = $queue->get();
    $queue->ack($message->getDeliveryTag());

### Producer

    $producerName = 'test-producer';
    $producer = ProducerFactory::$producerName($container);
    
    $producer->confirmSelect();
    $producer->publish(['foo' => 'bar'], 'my-routing-key');
    $producer->waitForConfirm();

### JSON RPC Client

    $clientName = 'my-client';
    $client = JsonRpcClientFactory::$clientName($container);
    $client->addRequest(new JsonRpcRequest('my-server', 'method', ['my' => 'params'], 'id-1'));
    $client->addRequest(new JsonRpcRequest('my-server', 'method', ['my' => 'other_params'], 'id-2'));
    $responseCollection = $client->getResponseCollection();

### JSON RPC Server

    $serverName = 'my-server';
    $server = JsonRpcServerFactory::$serverName($container);
    $server->consume();

## Notes

### AMQP-Extension

1) We recommend using php-amqp >=v1.7.1 or compiling it from master, if you encounter any problems with the amqp extension, check
their issue tracker, first. 

The ext-amqp driver is the most performant. Benchmarks are added soon. 


### PhpAmqpLib

1) There is currently a bug in PhpAmqpLib, see: https://github.com/php-amqplib/php-amqplib/pull/399
As long as this is not merged and release, you have to manually apply the patch, sorry!

You can do this from the command-line with:

`sed -i '/$message = $this->get_and_unset_message($delivery_tag);/a \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $message->delivery_info["delivery_tag"] = $delivery_tag;' vendor/php-amqplib/php-amqplib/PhpAmqpLib/Channel/AMQPChannel.php`

2) When using php-amqplib as driver, it's worth point out, that a StreamConnection (same goes for SSLConnection) does not
have the possibility to timeout. If you want to let the consumer timeout, when no more messages are received, you should
use the SocketConnection instead (assuming you don't need an SSL connection).

3) When using php-amqplib as driver and you're using the LazyConnection, you should not create the channel yourself, call
instead `$channel = $connection->newChannel()`
